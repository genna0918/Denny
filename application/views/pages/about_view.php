					<p>We are open, all right. We are open every hour of every day and you are welcome here whenever the whim hits you. We are open to good prices, so that everyone can leave satisfied. We’re open to all kinds of food for all kinds of tastes — with new specials all the time. We’re open to your suggestions. We’re open to your feedback. If you want to join us on Facebook, we’re open to that. It’s what a great diner does: it makes everyone comfortable whenever it can. It makes the world a nicer place, too. So as the door closes behind you, we hope you feel like it’s still kind of open. Wide open.</p>
